# EECS381-Project-1
Class: EECS381 Fall 2015

EECS381 is a class that is offered by University of Michigan. The goals of this class are to thoroughly learn C and C++ advanced programming techniques, design patterns, and object-oriented design. 

The purpose of this project is to use C as the programming language and implements a project manager program with two different approaches - pointers and arrays. 

Throughout this projects, I learnt to master pointers, encapsulation, design well hierachy functions to maximize reuse, create meaningful header files, uses opaque types to hide implementation details from client code, create generic data structure or container with void*.
